Developed a security system using computer vision, specifically focusing on real-time face and eyes detection.
Leveraged OpenCV for efficient image processing to identify faces and eyes within images and video streams.
Implemented a unique mechanism where, upon successful detection, the system triggers an audio alert for
enhanced security measures. This project showcases proficiency in computer vision, OpenCV, and the
integration of sensory feedback in practical security applications. Successfully optimized the model's
performance for reliable face and eyes recognition.
